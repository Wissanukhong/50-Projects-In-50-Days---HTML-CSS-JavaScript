        <h1 class="header-paragrap">Who Is Steve Wozniak</h1>
        <p class="p-paragraph">
            Steve Wozniak is an American computer scientist, inventor and programmer. In partnership
            with his friend Steve Jobs, Wozniak invented the Apple I computer. The pair founded Apple 
            Computers in 1976 with Ronald Wayne, releasing some of the first personal computers on the market. 
            Wozniak also personally developed the next model, Apple II, which established Apple as a major player in microcomputing.
        </p>

        <h1 class="header-paragrap">Early Life and Education</h1>
        <p class="p-paragraph">
            Stephen Gary Wozniak, born on August 11, 1950, in San Jose, California. Wozniak was 
            the son of an engineer at Lockheed Martin and was fascinated by electronics at an early age.
            Although he was never a star student in the traditional sense, Wozniak had an aptitude for
            building working electronics from scratch.
        </p>

        <h1 class="header-paragrap">Beginning of Apple Computer</h1>
        <p class="p-paragraph">
            Working out of a family garage, he and Jobs attempted to produce a user-friendly alternative to the computers that were being 
            introduced by International Business Machines at that time. Wozniak worked on the invention of products, and Jobs was responsible for marketing.
        </p>

        <h1 class="header-paragrap">Later Career</h1>
        <p class="p-paragraph">
            In February 1981, Wozniak was injured when the private plane he was piloting crashed while taking off from the Santa 
            Cruz Sky Park. His painstaking recovery lasted two years, as he suffered from a variety of injuries and amnesia.
        </p>

        <p class="p-paragraph">
            Following his accident and subsequent recovery, Wozniak went on to found numerous ventures, 
            including CL 9, the company responsible for the first programmable universal remote control.
        </p>

        <p class="p-paragraph">
            Called one of "Silicon Valley's most creative engineers," in 1990, he joined Mitchell Kapor in establishing
            the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization that provides legal aid for computer hackers facing criminal
            prosecution. Wozniak also founded Wheels of Zeus (WoZ) in 2002, a venture started with the aim of developing
            wireless GPS technology.
