    <p><strong>“The Principles”</strong> is the latest book by <strong>Ray Dalio</strong> — founder of <u>Bridgewater</u>, the world’s</p>
    <p>largest hedge fund. In this rather hefty tome of a book, Dalio offers an insight into</p>
    <p><i>the principles</i> which he’s applied throughout his life and work, and his underlying reflections.</p>
    <p>He kicks off the book by explaining that “Good principles are effective ways of dealing with reality” and that “To learn my own, I spend a lot of time reflecting.”</p>
